## Penguin Size and Mass by Sex and Species

Load packages and dataset.
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

Let's calculate the averages of all the numeric variables in the penguins dataset by species and sex.
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarise(
    across(
      where(is.numeric), 
      \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
      )
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Penguin Size vs Mass by Species

We assume that there would be a positive association between penguin size and mass. The larger the penguin, the heavier it would be.

Let's also add colour to distinguish the penguin species.
```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal()
```
